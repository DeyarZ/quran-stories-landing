        <p class="text-lg text-sage-600 leading-relaxed">Let's be honest — getting kids to pray consistently is one of the trickiest parts of raising a Muslim family. You want them to love salah, not resent it. Here's what's worked for us and so many other families.</p>
      </header>

      <div class="prose max-w-none space-y-6 text-sage-800">

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">I still remember the day my daughter, maybe six years old, pulled out her little prayer mat without being asked, stood next to me, and tried to follow along. She got most of the movements wrong. She whispered random Arabic words. It was absolutely beautiful.</p>

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">That moment didn't happen because I'd lectured her about the importance of salah. It happened because she'd watched me pray hundreds of times and finally wanted to be part of it. And that's really the secret, isn't it? Kids learn prayer the way they learn everything else — by watching, by doing, by <em>wanting</em> to.</p>

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">But I know it's not always that easy. Some days it's a battle. Some kids resist. Some go through phases. So here's a practical guide — organized by age — that I hope takes some of the stress off your shoulders.</p>

        <!-- Age Group 1 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-2xl p-6 sm:p-8 border border-sage-100">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-sage-900 mb-4">Ages 5–7: Plant the Seeds 🌱</h2>
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">At this age, it's all about exposure and positive association. You're not trying to build a five-times-a-day habit yet. You're planting seeds.</p>

          <ul class="space-y-3 text-base leading-relaxed">
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Let them imitate you.</strong> When you pray, invite them to stand next to you. Give them their own little prayer mat (kids love having their own). Don't correct every movement — just let them be part of it.</span></li>
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Make wudu together.</strong> Turn it into a little ritual. "Let's race to make wudu!" The splashing, the sequence — kids find it fun when you make it playful.</span></li>
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Teach one surah at a time.</strong> Start with Al-Fatiha. Then Al-Ikhlas. Make it a game — recite together in the car, before bed, during walks. When they memorize one, celebrate like they just scored a goal.</span></li>
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Tell stories about prayer.</strong> Share stories of the prophets who prayed — how Ibrahim prayed for his family, how Maryam was devoted to worship. Stories stick better than rules. (Our <a href="https://quran-stories-for-kids.vercel.app" class="text-sage-600 font-semibold underline decoration-sage-300 hover:text-sage-800">Quran Stories ebook</a> has beautifully illustrated versions that kids genuinely ask to read again.)</span></li>
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Never punish for missing prayer.</strong> At this age, prayer isn't obligatory. If you turn it into a punishment, you're creating a negative association that can last years.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Age Group 2 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-2xl p-6 sm:p-8 border border-sage-100">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-sage-900 mb-4">Ages 8–10: Build the Routine 🧱</h2>
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">Now you can start being more intentional. The Prophet (peace be upon him) told us to teach our children prayer at seven and encourage them at ten. This is the building phase.</p>

          <ul class="space-y-3 text-base leading-relaxed">
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Pray together consistently.</strong> This is the single most powerful thing you can do. If your child sees that prayer is non-negotiable for <em>you</em>, it becomes normal for them. Family prayer time — even if it's just one or two salawat together — is gold.</span></li>
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Teach the proper movements and words.</strong> Gently now. "Do you know what we say in ruku?" Walk them through it without making it feel like school. Some families use visual prayer guides or posters in the room.</span></li>
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Create a prayer tracker.</strong> A simple chart on the fridge where they put a sticker after each prayer. Kids love visual progress. Some families do a weekly "prayer goal" with a small reward.</span></li>
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Take them to the mosque.</strong> There's something about praying in congregation — the rows, the unity, the adhan echoing — that leaves a deep impression on children. Even once a week makes a difference.</span></li>
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Talk about why we pray.</strong> Not in a lecture-y way. More like: "You know what I love about salah? It's like a reset button. When I'm stressed or overwhelmed, I make wudu and pray, and I feel so much lighter." Share your real experience.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Age Group 3 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-2xl p-6 sm:p-8 border border-sage-100">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-sage-900 mb-4">Ages 11+: Strengthen the Habit 💪</h2>
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">This is when things get real. Puberty is approaching (or has arrived), and prayer becomes obligatory. Your child needs internal motivation now — not just "because Mom said so."</p>

          <ul class="space-y-3 text-base leading-relaxed">
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Give them ownership.</strong> Let them set their own prayer alarms. Let them choose their prayer spot. Autonomy builds responsibility. When they feel like it's <em>their</em> practice — not something imposed on them — everything shifts.</span></li>
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Address the phone problem honestly.</strong> We all know it — the biggest obstacle to prayer for tweens and teens is the phone. They're in the middle of a game, a chat, a video, and the adhan goes off. Tools like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/prayer-lock-noor/id6758148553" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-sage-600 font-semibold underline decoration-sage-300 hover:text-sage-800">Prayer Lock</a> can genuinely help here — it blocks distracting apps until prayer time, turning the phone from an obstacle into a reminder. No nagging from you needed.</span></li>
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Have real conversations about salah.</strong> "Do you ever feel like you're just going through the motions?" Ask them. Listen. Share your own struggles. Preteens and teens respond to authenticity, not perfection.</span></li>
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Connect them to a community.</strong> Youth halaqas, Islamic camps, even an online community of Muslim kids their age. When their peers pray, it normalizes it in a way parents alone can't.</span></li>
            <li class="flex gap-3"><span class="text-sage-500 font-bold">→</span><span><strong>Celebrate consistency, not perfection.</strong> "I noticed you've been praying Fajr all week — that's amazing." Positive reinforcement at this age goes a long way. Don't focus on what they're missing; highlight what they're doing right.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- The Hard Truth -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-sage-900 mt-10">The Part Nobody Talks About</h2>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Sometimes your child will go through a phase where they resist prayer. Maybe it's at 9, maybe at 14. It's scary and heartbreaking and normal. Almost every Muslim parent I know has been through it.</p>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Here's what I've heard from parents on the other side: don't panic. Keep praying yourself. Keep the door open. Keep the conversations gentle. A child who grew up watching their parents pray with love — who has warm memories of standing next to you on the prayer mat — will come back. They almost always come back.</p>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Your job isn't to force faith into their hearts. That's Allah's domain. Your job is to create the environment where faith can grow. And you're already doing that by caring enough to read this.</p>

        <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-2xl p-6 sm:p-8 mt-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-sage-900 mb-3">Quick Summary: The Key Principles</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-base text-sage-700">
            <li>✅ Start with imitation, not instruction</li>
            <li>✅ Pray together — it's the most powerful teaching tool</li>
            <li>✅ Make it warm, not stressful</li>
            <li>✅ Use age-appropriate tools and trackers</li>
            <li>✅ Celebrate effort, not perfection</li>
            <li>✅ Share your own relationship with salah honestly</li>
            <li>✅ Be patient during the resistant phases</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mt-6">May Allah make salah the coolness of our children's eyes, the way it's meant to be the coolness of ours. And may He make this journey easy for every parent reading this. 💚</p>
